# Railway Deployment Fix

## Problem
The API failed to deploy on Railway with the error:
```
Error: Cannot find module '/app/dist/src/index.js'
```

## Root Cause
The TypeScript configuration was compiled to ES2020 modules (ESM format), but:
1. Node.js on Railway was running in CommonJS mode
2. The main entry point was incorrectly pointing to `dist/src/index.js` instead of `dist/index.js`
3. The package.json declared `"type": "module"` which conflicted with the CommonJS output

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `tsconfig.json`
- Changed `"module": "ES2020"` → `"module": "commonjs"`
- This ensures TypeScript compiles to CommonJS format that Node.js can load natively

**Before:**
```json
"module": "ES2020",
```

**After:**
```json
"module": "commonjs",
```

### 2. Updated `package.json`
- Changed start script from `node dist/src/index.js` → `node dist/index.js`
- Changed main entry point from `dist/src/index.js` → `dist/index.js`

**Before:**
```json
"main": "dist/src/index.js",
"scripts": {
  "start": "node dist/src/index.js",
  ...
}
```

**After:**
```json
"main": "dist/index.js",
"scripts": {
  "start": "node dist/index.js",
  ...
}
```

## Result
✅ Build now produces:
- `dist/index.js` (with CommonJS require/exports)
- All modules properly compiled to `dist/` folder
- Compatible with Node.js 22.x on Railway

## Deployment Instructions for Railway

1. **Push to your Git repository:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: update typescript config for railway deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Railway will automatically:**
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`
   - Build the project: `npm run build`
   - Start the server: `npm start`

3. **Set Environment Variables in Railway Dashboard:**
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `PORT=3000` (or whatever Railway assigns)
   - `DB_HOST=your_mysql_host`
   - `DB_USER=your_db_user`
   - `DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password`
   - `DB_NAME=your_db_name`
   - `JWT_SECRET=your_random_secret_key`

## Verification

Test your deployment by:
```bash
# Locally verify it still works
npm run build
npm start

# Should see server running on configured port
# Health check: GET http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

## Notes
- The application is now using CommonJS modules which is the standard for Node.js
- TypeScript strict mode is still enabled for type safety
- All functionality remains the same, only the module format changed
